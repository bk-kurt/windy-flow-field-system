# windy-flow-field-system

I am working on an integration to conventional pathfinding that can be influenced by wind effect as patterns.

- We have a grid-based map where each cell contains a vector pointing towards a destination and can be influenced by wind. <br>
- Using a simple flow field and wind model.
